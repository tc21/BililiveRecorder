## Apology

GitHub is a global platform, and theoretically, everyone should use English. But since this project is only meant for Chinese user and rely on a Chinese website [BiliBili](https://live.bilibili.com) (_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili)_), all code comments are in Chinese. This README file will always use English so people like _you_ can understand what is this, and perhaps make some use out of it.

## Install & Use

See [rec.danmuji.org](https://rec.danmuji.org) (in Chinese)

## Feature

- Easy to use
- Fix timestamp automatically
- Start recording when stream starts
- Record multiple stream at same time
- Have a "Clip" Feature (just like [Twitch's](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2442508-how-to-use-clips))
- Pure C#, no native dependents
- Open source!

## Develop & Getting Started

You'll need:

- Visual Studio 2017 with .NET Core
- PowerShell

Some file are generated by [PreComplie Script](./CI/patch_buildinfo.ps1). Build project to clear errors shown by Visual Studio.

Project | Type | Note
:---:|:---:|:---
BililiveRecorder.WPF | .NET Framework 4.6.2
BililiveRecorder.Core | .NET Standard 2.0
BililiveRecorder.FlvProcessor | .NET Standard 2.0
BililiveRecorder.Server | .NET Core 2.0 | TODO

You can start poking around from...

- `BililiveRecorder.WPF/MainWindow.xaml` about WPF gui
- `BililiveRecorder.Core/Recorder.cs` about core record logic
- `BililiveRecorder.FlvProcessor/FlvStreamProcessor.cs` about FLV data process
